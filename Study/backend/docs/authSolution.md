1. My solution: Make use of loopback Authentication Component, loopback JWT extension, and loopack Authorization component

2. Strong point:
  + low difficulty in implementing 
  + a lot of documents in loopback.io
  + Many people also use this way

3. Weak points:
  + As a newbie to loobpack, 
  + Does not include third-party api
